# Assembler
Final Project in the course System Programming Lab by the Open University of Israel. The purpose of this project is to build an assembler for 16-instruction assembly language, for an imaginary 14-bit CPU with 14-bit & 256 words memory size. The author of this project is Lior Maman.


To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where the program files are located.

2. Run the make command to compile the program.

3. Run the assembler command followed by the name of the file(s) you want to assemble.

The file(s) should be in the .as format and the input should be provided without the .as extension.
